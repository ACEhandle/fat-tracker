🧠 App Concept Overview
You're building a cross-platform nutrition, workout, and inventory management app, something like:

📦 PantryPal meets 🏋️‍♂️ Strava-lite meets 🗓️ Google Calendar with a Flutter frontend and full backend sync.

🔑 Core Features

Feature	Description
🍽️ Food Tracking	Log food items with macros (protein, carbs, fat, calories)
🧑‍🍳 Meal Builder	Combine food items into meals (e.g., sandwiches, dinners)
📦 Inventory System	Track what food/ingredients are in your home (quantities, expiry)
🏋️ Workout Logging	Track workout routines, durations, calories burned
🔄 Syncing	All data available on both desktop & mobile
📆 Calendar Integration	Sync meals, workouts, or shopping to Google Calendar
📱 Mobile + Desktop	Use on phone when out, desktop at home
🧩 Tech Stack
🎯 Frontend: Flutter
Cross-platform (iOS, Android, Windows, macOS, Linux)

Smooth UI, animations, and single codebase

☁️ Backend Options:

Option	Notes
Firebase	Easy sync, auth, realtime data, great for MVP (Selected for this project)
Supabase	PostgreSQL + Auth + Realtime (open source Firebase alt)
Custom API	Dart (Shelf), Node.js, or Python (FastAPI) if you want full control

📦 Data Storage:
Firestore (Firebase) for user data (Selected for this project)

SQLite or Hive for offline support

🔐 Authentication:
Google, Apple, or email login

Firebase Auth (Selected for this project)

🗓️ Calendar API:
Google Calendar API for adding events (meal prep, grocery, workouts)

🧱 Sample Data Models (Dart-style)
dart
Copy
Edit
class FoodItem {
  String name;
  double protein, carbs, fat, calories;
  String? brand;
}

class Meal {
  String name;
  List<FoodItem> ingredients;
  DateTime createdAt;
}

class InventoryItem {
  FoodItem food;
  int quantity;
  DateTime? expiryDate;
}

class Workout {
  String type;
  Duration duration;
  double caloriesBurned;
  DateTime date;
}
🛠️ Development Strategy
Start with mobile-first Flutter UI

Build core features:

Add/log foods

Create meals

Track workouts

Inventory items

Integrate:

Syncing with Firebase/Supabase

Auth

Calendar (for reminders/shopping)

Expand to desktop (Flutter desktop shares 90%+ of code)

🧠 Next Steps
Do you want help sketching wireframes or building a Flutter starter repo?

Would you prefer Firebase or Supabase as the backend to prototype with?

Do you want offline-first (local DB syncing) or cloud-first?

Let me know and I can help you scaffold this thing out.
